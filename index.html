        In the grim darkness of the year 3225 most of the galaxy has fallen in the hands of an oppressive Empire,
        with the so-called "Eternal Emperor" ruling over humanity with an iron fist from his impenetrable fortress on the planet that used to be known as "Earth".
    </p>

    <p>
        But, hope is not yet lost. The Confederation of Independent Systems (C.I.S.) has elected you to lead the charge against the mad tyrant!
    </p>

    <p>
        Will you agree to lead the last bastions of freedom to victory?
        Or will you refuse and let the Eternal Emperor extinguish the last embers of freedom and enslave humanity for the rest of time?
    </p>

    <p>
        The fate of countless worlds rests in your hands.
    </p>
